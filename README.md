# Traffic-Sign-Classifier 

Classify traffic signs using CNNs

## Using Tensorflow and data augmentation
As part of Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree, implement LeNet5 model using Tensorflow. This also demonstrates the data augmentation techniques used to avoid overfitting.

## Keras - Finetuning VGG
Used Keras with backend as tensorflow.

This demonstrates how one can easily use keras pretrained models with weights.A lot of time was spent in earlier version while using Tensorflow directly and also defining data augmentation methods.

Used Keras ImageDataGenerator and finetuned VGG model by adding dense layer as the last layer.

This project also demonstrates on using keras save and load models.

Even though there was little difference in the accuracies in both methods, it can easily improved by experimenting with other imagenet models too by using Keras.
